You are an expert recruiter and ATS assistant. Extract all important details from the following input to create a structured dataset suitable for matching, scoring, or rewriting.
Input Type: {INPUT_TYPE} (either "JOB_DESCRIPTION" or "USER_RESUME")
The input may contain information about titles, skills, required skills, responsibilities, experience level, location, education, certifications, and keywords.

Provide a structured JSON output with these base keys:
{{
  "Title": "<job title or user title>",
  "Skills": [],
  "Responsibilities": [],
  "Experience Level": "",
  "Location": "",
  "Education": "",
  "Certifications": [],
  "Keywords": []
}}

In addition to the base keys, add any extra fields that appear in the input and are valuable for ATS matching, resume scoring, or resume rewriting.
Examples include (but are not limited to):
-> Achievements
-> Tools & Technologies
-> Projects
-> Soft Skills
-> Industry Expertise
-> Domain Knowledge
-> Notable Metrics
-> Publications
-> Awards

Only add these extra keys if they are explicitly present in the input.
Do not invent or assume information.

Ensure the JSON is:
Clean, concise, and structured
Fully based on actual content
Useful for accurate ATS‑style matching and resume optimization

Input:
{INPUT_CONTENT}
