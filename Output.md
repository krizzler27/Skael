Match Analysis:

```
{
  "Score_match": 78,
  "Explanation": "The user demonstrates a strong alignment with the AI Engineer role. Key strengths include proficiency in Python, Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs, AWS, Git, and experience with data pipelines and ML model deployment. The user's experience in developing and integrating ML models into production, optimizing model latency, and building data pipelines directly addresses the job responsibilities. Gaps include limited explicit mention of Large Language Models (LLMs), Generative AI, Prompt Engineering, and Agile Methodologies (SAFe, FAST). To improve fit, the user should highlight any experience with LLMs and Generative AI, and emphasize their ability to work in agile environments. Certifications in cloud platforms like Azure or Vercel would further enhance their profile."
